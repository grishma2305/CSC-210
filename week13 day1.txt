private only accessible within class

getters and setters are effectibvely methods

visibility modifier will be public

a getter ans setter are always public
	bcoz other classes can access it

visibililty ensures how protected datafeilds are

class public
	but data feild may change

loose data encapsulation 
	leads to lacking of data

ensure methods are well encapsulated
	so protects from accidental tampering
	and less bug

we have more control on how and who access the data
