variable remains inside that particular method 
that is scope of variable

so need to change the name in slide 10 of max

Call Stack
	activation record

every method has activation record
	stack of calls like pile of books

if just print then mention return type as void
	as in slide 27

in slide 31 in order to get updated vaue of x
	we need to return the value of x

Overloading
	same function, but different kind of values
	i.e dataypes are different but method name same
	
	multiple methods with same name
	different number of parameters or returnn-type

Modularize code

DRY- Do not Repeat Yourself

Abstraction and Encapsulation
	hiding all the details underneath and enabling the details only you need too show
	hiding the complex logic
