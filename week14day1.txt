Abstraction and encapsulation

a private var and getter and setters to modify it
	practice of encapsulation


public methods and public feilds are called class contacts

private feilds hidden from clients

need to be hidden or protected are protected

higher the level or generic is the class

Animal(parent class) : dog and cat are child classess

eg animal is more generic
 whereas dog and child gets more specific

extends
	extending the parent/super class to make more specific child/sub class

protected
	works like private for all other class
	works like public for it's child class

not all inheritance works straight forward

A class only extends single parent class\

super: for super or parent class

All classes are derived from super class

slide 19
	faculty -> grand parent class
	exployee -> parent class
	person -> child class
heirarchy
chain of constructor calls to create pbjects


override
	declared it but need to replace it so
	making a new one specifc to our class

static method can't be over ridden

overloading: all methods in same class
overriding: diff class and one inherits the other
