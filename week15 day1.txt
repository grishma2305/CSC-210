Try-catch block
	it's like if the exception occures
	then go to catch block

why use try-catch instead of if else
	bcoz want to separate of logidc of detection of exception

if else to solve logical part of program
try catch no logical part but
	figure a way to handle error during exception


in slide 10 
	ex is just a variable name

can write multiple catch blocks


catch(Exception e) -> the most generic one
	will cath all exception
	will be able to handle it properting

finally -> dpes mot tahing anythithing
