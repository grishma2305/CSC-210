 First Class Circle

	property/data fields
		double radius;

	behavior/methods
		public double getArea(){
		return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
	}
		public double getPerimeter(){
		return 2 * 3.14159 * radius;
	}
	

Construct: constructs objects out of the class
 similar to a method
 can have no, 1 or more than 1 paramter
 

Scanner  inputObj  =  new  Scanner (System.in)
class    variable   keyword  class   argument
          object             constructor
