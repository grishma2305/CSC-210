Method

modifier : public static
return-value-type: void
method name: main(any name with lower case, give appropriate acc to its function)
parameters: type string or int or double(can be multiple)

can't write a method inside a method

return value and return-value-type needs to be consistent
that both needs to be of the same datatype


not necessary that void and list of parameters are empty(no relation bt/w 2)

no need to write return statement in void

notice diff b/w parameter and arguments
