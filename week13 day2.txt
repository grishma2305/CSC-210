this refers to object level variable
 that is the class level

and not this then refers to local level variable


this means object so also means calling a constructor

********
circle constructor which takes in color name

	then need to have default constructor
	to get value of radius
	then color it

in other words

public Circle(String color){
	this();
	this.color = color;
}

public Circle () {
	this.radius = 1.0;
}

method calling a method

********

toString() method

Circle c = new Circle();
sout(c);

here it will call a method c.toString();
that too automatically
gives memory location where object is present

if we define toString method it will over write the exisiting default toString() method
