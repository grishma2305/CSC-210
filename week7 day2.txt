mid term upto array

arrayName [indexposition] = value
	eg arrayname[0] = 4;

when
	array1 = array2
	both will point to the same memory location
 but not the case with single values
		only for thw whole array

	twist comes in copying the array
	slide 10

if we do not want to modify our original array
then need to reutrn so as to get a copy and originial stays the same
